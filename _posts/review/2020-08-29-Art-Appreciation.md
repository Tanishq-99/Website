# Art Appreciation Is Declining

### Why should we appreciate art?

Art is the only form of expression humanity has. Every person enjoys a song, a melody, a picture, a weaving, or a design—it can be anything. Everything falls under the artistic umbrella. Some people are more connected to it, so they dedicate their whole lives to learning it.

This is where artists come from.  
Now, moving on to why we should support or appreciate anyone’s work:

**“Sophistication”**  
Everyone on this planet does something beyond just working, hiding, eating, and sleeping. Even people who don’t “hide”—like homeless individuals or beggars—often do something: sing, paint, express themselves in some way (unless they’re battling addiction, etc.). So we can infer that people do more than just survive. That’s sophistication (at least how I see it)... because animals don’t do this—they didn’t build a society.

Nowadays, people are on a spectrum: either they lean into creativity, or they live passively on the other side of the screen.  
But there’s a growing number of people who do nothing—just go to work, come home, drink beer, semi-watch a series or movie, and sleep. That’s it.  
At least this is happening a lot in my state and country.

These people are full of dreams, but not creativity. Their focus is on lifestyle—buying property, building big houses, playing the money game, building bodies to impress the opposite gender, and so on. You know the type, right?

Being connected to some form of art is not only good for your creative thinking—it also helps you feel included. Whether it’s a small photography club or a large jazz community, it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that you’re keeping your brain active, creative, and thinking.

### What happens when we appreciate?

Nobody gets anything tangible. Literally. BUT—it’s where sophistication speaks. And *you* speak.

People contribute so much to society, but rarely to something they love.  
If I love trees and nature, planting a few trees a month makes me feel good inside and out.  
Learning about trees, creating awareness about your interests—that’s *you* being you.

When people live just to “live,” they miss the point.  
When people work only to work—even in art—they also miss the point.

Not everyone can do what they love. Day jobs consume most of our time.  
But we can still *appreciate* and *support* the things we care about.

Once upon a time, people supported art because it was their main source of entertainment.  
Now, it’s different. Movies are the only "acceptable" form of commodified art.

### Can we do anything?

Honestly, I don’t know.  
Art has always found a way to survive—just in niche corners.  
The best we can do is contribute where we can, support what we love, and move on.
